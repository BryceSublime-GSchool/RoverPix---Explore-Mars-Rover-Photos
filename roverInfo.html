    <li>Investigating martian climate and geology, assessment of whether or not the Gale Crater has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for microbial life (water and planetary habitability).</li>

    <li>Investigate the building blocks of life (carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur). </li>

  <ul>
<br>
<br>
  <li>Mast Camera -  MastCam - True Color images 1600X1200px, 720p video. 8 gigabytes of memory. </li>
<br>
  <li>Chemistry and Camera complex - ChemCam - two different instruments:  laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy and a Remote Micro Imager. The laser vaporizes soil samples up to 23 feet away from the drone and the Remote Micro Imager provides a high-resolution image of the sample.</li>
<br>
  <li>NavCam - Two pairs of black and white cameras mounted on the mast and create a stereoscopic 3-D image. </li>
<br>
  <li>Hazard Avoidance Camera - HazCams - four pairs of black and white cameras. They are used for autonomous hazard avoidance during rover drives and for safe positioning of the robotic arm on rocks and soils.</li>
<br>
  <li>Mars Hand Lens Imager - MAHLI - MAHLI is a camera on the rover's robotic arm, and acquires microscopic images of rock and soil. </li>
<br>
  <li>Mars Descent Imager - MARDI - During the descent to the Martian surface, MARDI took color images at 1600×1200 pixels with a 1.3-millisecond exposure time starting at distances of about 3.7 km (2.3 mi) to near 5 m (16 ft) from the ground, at a rate of four frames per second for about two minutes.</li>
